You radio a status report to the Moray and tell them that you are going to cast off from the line and descend under your own power. Your plan is approved and you cast off your line. Now you are on your own. The Seeker slips noiselessly into the undersea canyon.
      </p>
      <p>
As you drop into the canyon, you turn on the Seeker's powerful searchlight. Straight ahead is a dark wall covered with a strange type of barnacle growth. To the left (port) side you see what appears to be a grotto. The entrance is perfectly
round, as if it had been cut by human hands.
</p>
<p>
Lantern fish give off a pale, greenish light. To the right (starboard) side of the Seeker you see bubbles rising steadily from the floor of the canyon.
  </p>
<p3>
If you decide to investigate the bubbles, choose option 1
</p3>

<p4>
If you decide to investigate the grotto with the round entrance, choose option 2
