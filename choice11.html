The giant squid tosses and turns the Seeker, but finally the creature grows tired of its new game and jets off with an enormous squirt of water. You now are free to leave your hiding place and examine the Seeker for damage.
      </p>
      <p>
To your dismay, the airlock entrance has been jammed shut. You are locked out of the Seeker. The crew of the Maray, however, suspected trouble when you did not respond to a routine radio check and they are now lowering an escape plat- form to you. Once on the platform, you radio them to start the slow pull to the surface. To avoid the bends—rapid expansion of nitrogen bubbles in your blood—they will have to bring you up very slowly.
</p>
<p>
Just as the platform begins to move, the giant squid suddenly returns as if from nowhere. It is headed directly at you.
  </p>
<p3>
If you decide to fight the squid with your spear gun, hoping to scare it off, choose option 1
</p3>
<br>
<p4>
If you decide to signal Maray to pull you up at top speed, knowing you will get the bends, choose option 2
